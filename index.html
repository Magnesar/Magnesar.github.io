<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a 1st year masters student of physics at Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal Unniversity.</p>
<p> I am immensely passionate about physics, love learning new things and solving problems.
    I frequently use python and scilab as primary tools for the same, most of which  can be found on

<p>I am also a novice in the fields of machine learning and neural networks,and routinely work with said
    data, which i've learned using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/theholyfuck">kaggle</a> </p>
